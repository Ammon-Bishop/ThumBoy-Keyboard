I made a video about the process that you can watch here:

I did something tacky with the pcb; i had an edge that was supposed to be straight that was actually made of very slightly angle-varying lines because i had positioned the mcu and power switch using either a 1mm, .5mm, or .25mm grid i think. point is, dont do this yourself when designing a keyboard. in addition my point is it would be nice if someone brave were to fab these pcbs and build the board and confirm whether it fits inside the case printed with the files provided (it really should; i was only off by probably .004mm max. mine should even fit; may have to sand it, though.) i designed the case files that are on this repo to work with the version of the pcb that has that edge as perfectly straight and has the mcu and power switch positioned perfectly, to the .001mm. to be clear, there shouldnt be any problems with the cases and pcbs on this repo, just want to give fair warning that i havent physically tested the exact pcb geometries on this repo with the case files on this repo.
will update this readme when someone has confirmed and has let me know.

this was my first keyboard design, so lmk if anything can be improved and i will look into it. should be pretty much just ready to print/fabricate and use.
enjoy!
